# Contributing

## Workflow

- `main` is always releasable. Every change goes through a pull request and is **squash-merged**.
- The **PR title becomes the commit message** and must be a [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, `revert:`. Mark breaking changes with `!` (`feat!: …`) or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in the PR description. The `pr-title` check validates this.
- Run `make ci` before pushing. CI runs the same targets.
- Run `make hooks` once per clone: a `pre-push` git hook then runs `make lint` and `make test` (about 20 s) before every push, and stops the push if either fails. To push work in progress so it isn't lost (onto a branch or draft PR), `SKIP_CHECKS=1 git push` (or `git push --no-verify`) skips the checks once. Use it sparingly: CI still runs every check on the PR.
- **All checks must be green before merging.** Branch protection on `main` enforces it, and the release gate re-runs everything before publishing anything.

## CI (`.github/workflows`)

| Workflow | When | What |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | Every PR | `make lint`, the speech engine, `make vuln`, `make secrets`, and `make test` → `make fuzz` → `make test-vt` → `make test-app` → build the app |
| `pr-title.yml` | PRs | Conventional Commit title check |
| `codeql.yml` | PRs, pushes to `main`, Mondays | CodeQL scans the Go (as macOS builds it), Swift and workflow code, into the repo's Security tab. Swift builds the app on the cached Ghostty build, and the speech helper's own code; the helper with MLX, a long build of other people's code, only on `main` and Mondays. It replaces GitHub's default setup, which must stay off for it to upload, and it isn't a required check |
| `ghostty-watch.yml` | Mondays | Opens an issue for a newer Ghostty release, or an advisory not in `.github/ghostty-advisories-reviewed.txt`. Dependabot can't watch Ghostty, as `scripts/build-ghostty.sh` pins it |
| `release.yml` | push to `main` | release-please; on a release: gate (`make ci fuzz`), then build and sign the app, publish it to the public tap and update the cask. |

Workflows run on GitHub-hosted runners: `macos-26` for anything that builds, `ubuntu-latest` for the rest. The repo is public, so they're free, and a PR from a fork never runs on anyone's own machine. `.github/actions/macos-tools` sets up Go, Zig and Xcode's Metal toolchain, and caches the Ghostty build and the speech helper (`SPEECH_CACHE`, keyed on its sources, the Makefile and Xcode's version, which saves about 10 minutes of building MLX). CI skips release PRs and release commits, since the release gate runs every check on that commit. `main` needs a PR, and `lint`, `swift`, `vuln`, `macos` and `pr-title` must pass. Dependabot's titles start with `chore` or `ci`, so merging one doesn't make a release: it ships with the next `fix` or `feat`.

## Releases

1. Merge PRs with Conventional Commit titles.
2. release-please keeps a PR titled `chore(main): release X.Y.Z` up to date, with the version bump and `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Merge it. The `release` workflow tags `vX.Y.Z`, runs the gate, builds and signs the app, publishes the public tap release `agent-command-vX.Y.Z`, and updates `Casks/agent-command.rb` in [brettmostert/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/brettmostert/homebrew-tap).
4. If the gate fails, nothing is published and the release is marked `[FAILED]`. Fix it and ship the next patch version. Never move or reuse tags.

Versioning is SemVer. Before 1.0, `feat` bumps the minor version and `fix` the patch. Breaking changes bump the minor version too.

## One-time repository setup

The GitHub App (`RELEASE_APP_CLIENT_ID` variable, `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` secret) opens release PRs and publishes to the tap.

Releases are signed with one long-lived self-signed certificate, because the project has no Apple Developer account. Create it once with `scripts/create-signing-cert.sh`, and store the results as the `ACMD_SIGNING_P12` and `ACMD_SIGNING_PASSWORD` secrets. `scripts/import-signing-cert.sh` imports it for a release; CI's `macos` job runs the same script with a throwaway certificate on every PR, so a release is never the first time signing runs on a fresh runner. `scripts/build-ghostty.sh` keeps its result in `~/.cache/agent-command/ghostty`, which CI caches. It rebuilds when the release, tools or script change, and deleting that folder forces a rebuild.

## Tool versions

Pinned in the `Makefile` (`make tools` installs them into `./bin`). GitHub Actions are pinned to commit SHAs and updated weekly by Dependabot.
